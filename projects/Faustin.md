[see me in action!](http://faustin.me)

A web application which analyzes both the tonal and semantic emotions in a .wav sound file.

Faustin was created during YHacks with a team consisting of three students from the University of Waterloo and one UC Berkeley student, all freshmen.

We employed IBM Watson's voice to text and text to speech API for breaking down the speech semantic wise and the Volkaturi API for a deep neural network for analyzing the .wav file directly. Bootstrap was used as the primary source of aesthetic presentation.

I am currently hosting this app using a virtual machine from AWS running centOS 7.
